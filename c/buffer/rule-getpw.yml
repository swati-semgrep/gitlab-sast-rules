  message: |
    The getpw() function is dangerous as it may overflow the provided
    buffer when reading from the `/etc/passwd` file.  While the passwd file
    is not generally writeable, there are no protections offered by this function
    to protect from reading past the bounds of the destination buffer. This function
    is obsoleted by `getpwuid`.

    For more information please see: https://linux.die.net/man/3/getpwuid
