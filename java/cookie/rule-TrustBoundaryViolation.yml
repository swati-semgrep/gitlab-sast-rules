  message: |
    A trust boundary can be thought of as line drawn through a program. On one side
    of the line, data is untrusted. On the other side of the line, data is assumed
    to be trustworthy. The purpose of validation logic is to allow data to safely
    cross the trust boundary - to move from untrusted to trusted. A trust boundary
    violation occurs when a program blurs the line between what is trusted and what
    is untrusted. By combining trusted and untrusted data in the same data
    structure, it becomes easier for programmers to mistakenly trust unvalidated
    data.
