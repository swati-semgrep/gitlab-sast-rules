  message: |
    The application is returning user-supplied data from an HTTP request to an HTTP response's
    `sendError` method. This could lead to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) if the input were malicious
    script code and the application server is not properly validating the output. Note that Apache
    Tomcat 9 and above automatically encode the output and are not vulnerable.

    XSS is an attack which exploits a web application or system to treat user input
    as markup or script code. It is important to encode the data depending on the specific context
    it is used in. There are at least six context types:

    - Inside HTML tags `<div>context 1</div>`
    - Inside attributes: `<div class="context 2"></div>`
    - Inside event attributes `<button onclick="context 3">button</button>`
    - Inside script blocks: `<script>var x = "context 4"</script>`
    - Unsafe element HTML assignment: `element.innerHTML = "context 5"`
    - Inside URLs: `<iframe src="context 6"></iframe><a href="context 6">link</a>`

    Script blocks alone have multiple ways they need to be encoded. Extra care must be taken if
    user input
    is ever output inside of script tags.

    User input that is displayed within the application must be encoded, sanitized or validated
    to ensure it cannot be treated as HTML or executed as Javascript code. Care must also be
    taken
    to not mix server-side templating with client-side templating, as the server-side templating
    will
    not encode things like {{ 7*7 }} which may execute client-side templating features.

    It is _NOT_ advised to encode user input prior to inserting into a data store. The data will
    need to be
    encoded depending on context of where it is output. It is much safer to force the displaying
    system to
    handle the encoding and not attempt to guess how it should be encoded.

    If possible do not use user input directly in the output to the `sendError` message parameter.

    Regardless if the application server handles output encoding, consider encoding any
    user-supplied
    input
    that is used in the sendError method:

    Example using [Apache Commons Text](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-text/)
    `StringEscapeUtils.escapeHtml4`:
    ```
    // Get user input
    String userInput = request.getParameter("key");
    // Encode the input using the Html4 encoder
    String encoded = StringEscapeUtils.escapeHtml4(userInput);
    // Respond with the error code and value
    response.sendError(401, encoded);
    ```
