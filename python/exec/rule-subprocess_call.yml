    Python possesses many mechanisms to invoke an external executable. However,
    doing so may present a security issue if appropriate care is not taken to
    sanitize any user provided or variable input. This plugin test is part of a
    family of tests built to check for process spawning and warn appropriately.
    Specifically, this test looks for the spawning of a subprocess without the
    use of a command shell. This type of subprocess invocation is not
    vulnerable to shell injection attacks, but care should still be taken to
    ensure validity of input.
