  message: |
    SQL Injection is a critical vulnerability that can lead to data or system compromise. By
    dynamically generating SQL query strings, user input may be able to influence the logic of
    the SQL statement. This could lead to an adversary accessing information they should
    not have access to, or in some circumstances, being able to execute OS functionality or code.

    Replace all dynamically generated SQL queries with parameterized queries. In situations where
    dynamic queries must be created, never use direct user input, but instead use a map or
    dictionary of valid values and resolve them using a user supplied key.

    For example, some database drivers do not allow parameterized queries for `>` or `<` comparison
    operators. In these cases, do not use a user supplied `>` or `<` value, but rather have the
    user
    supply a `gt` or `lt` value. The alphabetical values are then used to look up the `>` and `<`
    values to be used in the construction of the dynamic query. The same goes for other queries
    where
    column or table names are required but cannot be parameterized.

    Example using `PreparedStatement` queries:
    ```
    import sqlite3

    # Create a new database (in memory)
    con = sqlite3.connect(":memory:")
    # Get a cursor from the connection
    cur = con.cursor()
    # Create a tuple of the value to be used in the parameterized query
    params = ('user-input',)
    # execute the statement, passing in the params for the value
    cur.execute("select name from sqlite_master where name = ?", params)
    # work with the result
    result = cur.fetchall()
    ```
